# sctree

The goal of sctree is to ...

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:


# Reproducing the runs in the purdue cluster

To reproduce the runs in the purdue cluster run as follows ...

1. We get the data from the temporary directory

```
git clone https://github.rcac.purdue.edu/jpaezpae/data_sctree data
cd data
bash untar_data.bash
```

2. We run the standard seurat workflow.

This will output a report and generate an .RDS file for each of the final 
seurat objects

```
bash ./bash/build_jobs_seurat_workflow.bash ./data/filtered_matrices_mex_5050/hg19/ mix5050
bash ./bash/build_jobs_seurat_workflow.bash ./data/filtered_matrices_mex_9901/hg19 mix9901 
```

3. Whenever those are done, run this ...

This will run the benchmarks for the datasets. Will also generate 2 .RDS files
containing a list with a lot of stuff in it.

```
for i in seurat*.RDS ; do bash ./bash/build_jobs_acc_benchmark.bash $i ; done
```

# Steps down the road

1. Make figure list.
2. Start actually writting the verbose part of the paper.
3. Address some of the TODO's in this repository
