# Usage

I am assuming you have already done your clustering and dimensional reduction
using seurat and we have our seurat object.

For this examples we will use a dummy dataset that come bundled with the package

`small_5050_mix`, this dataset comes originally from the 1:1 mixture of Jurkat 
and 293T cells provided by 10x.

Original data can be found here:

1. [1:1 mixture](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/jurkat:293t_50:50)
2. [99:1 mixture](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/jurkat_293t_99_1)


```{r}
library(sctree)
library(Seurat)

set.seed(6)

data(small_5050_mix)
small_5050_mix

DimPlot(small_5050_mix, reduction = "tsne")
```
