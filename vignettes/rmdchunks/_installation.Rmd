# Installation

Currently we are not hosted in CRAN but the package can be
installed by using the following function in R

```r
remotes::install_github("jspaezp/sctree")
```


Alternatively, one can clone the git repository to test changes.

```
git clone https://github.rcac.purdue.edu/jpaezpae/sctree sctree
cd sctree

R -e "devtools::install('.')"
```
