## Finding antibodies for the experiment

Since we acknowledge most experimental workflows need antibodies. We have 
implemented several functions to look for antibodies in vendor websites, as well
as some helper functions to find the other posible aliases a gene might have.

Here is a simple example for a gene widely know to have an antibody available

```{r}
head(query_biocompare_antibodies("CD11b"))
```
